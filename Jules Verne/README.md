# Jules Verne Testcorpus

Since the goal of this project was to create a workflow to **access the spatial footprint of a text**, we used the novel "Around the World in Eighty Days" (*ger.: "In 80 Tagen um die Welt"*) by Jules Verne (1873) to develop and test different approaches.

+ high quality of fulltext: manually transcribed instead of OCR
+ publication date roughly similar to travelogues corpus: similar speech patterns (NER)
+ available in german: same language
+ well-known text: easy to establish ground truth
