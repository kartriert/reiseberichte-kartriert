# Reiseberichte karTRIERt (Mapping Travelogues)

## A repository for code and data developed in the Projektseminar "Praxis der Digital Humanities" (WiSe 2022/23) at Trier University

### Introduction to the project and its ideas

During the course of this semester, we, a group of seven students, are to create, execute and wrap-up
a self-chosen project in the field of Digital Humanities. 
As key to the ideas behind this project with the name "Reiseberichte karTRIER", we chose the process of transforming
locations and respective information from textual data to actual geographic maps.

Two data repositories build the bases of this plan:

First of, we chose the [Travelogues project](https://www.travelogues-project.info) and their corpus of
travel reports from the 18th century (they also provide data from the 16th and 17th century; reasons for choosing only one century
will be explained in the corresponding [subproject description](travelogues_postcorrection/README.md)).

Moreover, we also built a corpus of Jules Vernes travelogues ... blahblahblahblah.

### Subprojects and their workflows
